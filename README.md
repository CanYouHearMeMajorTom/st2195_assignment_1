# Practice Assignment 1
This assignment is the **FIRST** of many assignments that I will be creating and uploading over the next few months.

## Below are the two programming Languages that we will now be working on
	1. R
	2. Python
Both of of these are highly versatile programming languages that are the industry standard since they are widely adopted by all.
This assignment has required us perform a simple task to print the first 10 numbers. 
>'print('the first 10 numbers are :' 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)'
This is the required format for *python*
whereas R required a slightly different syntax that meant everything had to be printed as a string
>print("the required numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10")

A Jupyter notebook file and R Markdown file were then created to demonstrate our understanding of the two and effective commentation of our code.

following this all files created were saved in a local ** git version controlled ** repository on my local machine and then uploaded to github a *online file repository*
